# Getting your Raspberry Pi

* **You must purchase a Raspberry Pi that will be brought into class for work and will be used as the basis for configuration assignments, the recommended \(tech supportable by your instructor\) version would be to order:** 
  * * The newer Raspberry Pi 4B \([https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)\) or Raspberry Pi 3B / 3B+ \([https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)\) will be ideal & is what the lessons are based on. RPi Zero may not work for you or you may require your own investigations to make it work. Please see the details of purchasing at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/\#buying](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/faqs/#buying). The base cost of just the board \(no power charger, cable for monitor, keyboard, mouse, case, or mini-SD card\). It is possible that you will have to upgrade your operating system and/or software packages, but troubleshooting these issues will be part of the learning process. 
    * Brand new, with none of the needed extras the board only costs $35. You will also need a power cable & a micro SD card. To run the little machine at home, you’ll also want: cables \(HDMI if RPi 3B/4B or mini HDMI & USB OTG for R Pi Zero\); the actual monitor & the keyboard & mouse. You can buy a whole kit with basics & extras for more through such sites as Vilros \(e.g., [https://vilros.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=raspberry-pi-kits&gclid=CjwKCAjwqZPrBRBnEiwAmNJsNo3tkTtGDS8Q-KldfsXXVOMo7hnJp\_jThnQDHa88s0-YWkMRh-tn8hoCBrQQAvD\_BwE&page=1&rb\_snize\_facet14=RP4%7CRP3B%2B](https://vilros.com/pages/search-results-page?collection=raspberry-pi-kits&gclid=CjwKCAjwqZPrBRBnEiwAmNJsNo3tkTtGDS8Q-KldfsXXVOMo7hnJp_jThnQDHa88s0-YWkMRh-tn8hoCBrQQAvD_BwE&page=1&rb_snize_facet14=RP4%7CRP3B%2B)\) or Canakit \([https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-2gb.html](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-2gb.html)\). 
    * To set up your Raspberry Pi, you will need:
      * Power cable / charger, compatible with the Pi
      * a micro SD card for the operating system
      * cable for display/monitor \(e.g., HDMI\)
      * keyboard \[user supplies, not part of most kits\]
      * mouse \[user supplies, not part of most kits\]
      * A monitor \[user supplies, not part of most kits\]
      * wired / wireless networking, if you want this computer to be online
      * \(optional\) a Pi case \(alternatively, you may 3d print a case or try out the cardboard punnet case plans at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6424](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6424) - may need modification\)
    * We need the Pis to be received by the time we begin our section on computing \(Week 3\).
* I’ve expended considerable time trying to ensure that this is a low-cost \(& as open as possible a\) course for you. If you have problems affording your Pi, however, please let me know.
