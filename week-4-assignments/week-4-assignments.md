# Week 4 - Assignments - Part 1

## Part 1: Help Others Learn Git / CLI \(Command Line Interface\)

**All must be submitted via Github. If you have problems handing in your assignments, contact the professor for a walk-through.**

Up to 5 points \(up to 3 extra credit points, based on additional scope/quality refinements, beyond the basic requirements.\) 

You must choose one of the following 3 options:

#### Option \#1:

A git tutorial / exercise / lesson / revision of an assignment that you’ve been given on a git workflow. \(Some examples might be: creating a new git repository & using it; forking a github repository & using it; cloning down a github repository & using it; branching and merging a github repo.\) _The more complex the workflow & commands involved - the longer the lesson / tutorial - the more likely it is to get the full 3 extra credit points._  
  
_**If you fail to attribute/cite/reference what your work is based upon, you will get 0 regular points.**_ If you invented a git exercise from whole cloth, you must cite in your references where you got the git information from that your exercise is based upon, e.g., [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or cite which lesson/lecture you learned it from. 

* Your assignment can be based on exercises/lessons/assignments that you have encountered in the course so far, but you must cite that work. Alternatively, you can find and use other sources - your best bet to avoid copyright infringement is to use a Creative Commons / openly licensed work, such as the _Pro Git_ ebook, available online for free at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
* You cannot just cut and paste in an exercise you found and you must find a way to add value to the lesson/exercise/ assignment \(and - to repeat - you must attribute the origin of the exercise\). 
* You need to customize, test, and produce a better version of the assignment/exercise than you found originally \(and, of course, you must attribute the source of the exercise\). It may be that the original exercise was not detailed enough or did not work and needs revision. You may have seen a weakness that you can fix by a revision of the exercise/tutorial/lesson/assignment. Please make a note of what you are seeking to fix up if that is the case.

I will have you use the APA style guide for citations. If you’re citing a website, try one of the folllowing: [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research\_and\_citation/apa\_style/apa\_formatting\_and\_style\_guide/reference\_list\_electronic\_sources.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_electronic_sources.html) or [http://www.easybib.com/reference/guide/apa/website](http://www.easybib.com/reference/guide/apa/website). If you’re citing an ebook try this: [https://libguides.dixie.edu/c.php?g=57887&p=371717](https://libguides.dixie.edu/c.php?g=57887&p=371717)

**To get the full 5 regular points, your assignment needs to include:**

1. learning objectives \(goals for the user of the exercise - what students should know or be able to do by the end of the exercise\). For more on learning objectives, review [http://batchwood.herts.sch.uk/files/Learning-Objectives.pdf](http://batchwood.herts.sch.uk/files/Learning-Objectives.pdf)
2. content - the recipe of steps for the user to follow; written text describing the lesson/exercise; screenshots or illustrations, as appropriate
3. citation / reference -  APA-formatted citation to reference how you gained information to inform this exercise.

**Grading quality rubrics:**

* the tutorial/lesson/cheatsheet clearly cites what it is based on in APA citation format  \(the better the citation's formatting, the higher the number of points\)
* the tutorial/lesson/cheatsheet offers learning objectives that are clear
* the tutorial/exercise/lesson/cheatsheet/homework revision has content that supports the learning objectives - including all necessary steps, in ways that are clear and reproducible.

#### Option \#2:

A quiz around git commands, 15 questions \(_no more than 5 being true/false_\). 

**To get the full 5 regular points, your assignment needs to include:**

* A list of learning objectives that the quiz questions assess. 
* You must provide:
  * the questions
  * their answers \(if multiple choice, a short explanation of why the incorrect answers are wrong and why the correct one is right\)
  * plus where you found those answers and/or can reference more information to expand on understanding of the question's topic
* You may not base this on another git quiz that you found online. I have searched for and reviewed many git quizzes, so this is not a good approach. If I discover that you have been academically dishonorable in your assignment \(stealing and not citing another's work\) you will be penalized per the syllabus and will also get 0 points for the exercise. 

**To get additional extra credit points:**

* make your quiz longer by at least 5 questions \(none of which can be true/false\)

#### Option \#3:

A git and/or command line cheat sheet that you have created for this class, _**paired with**_ a short reflective \(approx. 1 page/500 words\) essay on the git/command line work that we have been doing \(why git might be useful, what your experience of learning it was, what helped or hurt that learning\). 

* If you take from another cheatsheet, you will have to customize it as your own and cite it correctly. If you did not do the majority of the work of the cheatsheet's creation, be certain to add value to the assignment through an increased length / quality of your reflective essay. 
* If you came up with the cheatsheet yourself entirely, please cite how you learned the material in the cheatsheet \(you can use an APA citation for lectures format, for example\). 
* APA citation required for references / sources of cheatsheet, as with options \#2 & \#1.
* Either way, the more effort you put in, the more likely you are to gain the 3 EC points, as well as the original 5 regular points.
