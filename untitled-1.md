# Week 7 - Assignment

## Wee**k 7: HTML/CSS - Going Deeper into CSS & Its Application to HTML** 

### **Up to 5 regular points:**

Fork either your existing Week 6 homework OR the class organization’s css-practice repository \(see: [https://github.com/ccsu-te350/css-practice](https://github.com/ccsu-te350/css-practice)\). 

For up to 5 regular credit points, due by 10/16/19 at class time, please do this & email me the address of your github repository. BTW, I will be validating the CSS and HTML this time, so ensure that you have done the same \(you can also get extra credits by demonstrating that you have done this through screenshots of this work added to your repo, see point \#2\):

1. Apply an external stylesheet
2. Add an html comment above the external stylesheet reference, indicating that you know that the external stylesheet link’s code is below
3. Do the following with styles:
   1. add a background-color and base font-size and font-family to your web page via the style sheet
   2. add at least 1 new style inline on an html element
   3. give all of your headings a different font-family than the primary font-family
   4. style at least one element using an id 
   5. style at least one element using a class
   6. have at least one element that uses both a class and an id style
   7. put a legal, labelled for reuse image in an html block specifically designed to house that image \(e.g., use a &lt;figure&gt; tag. Make sure you have alt text for image and a caption. Center your image in the page. Give the image some padding, and a border. 

### **Up to 2 extra credit points:**
