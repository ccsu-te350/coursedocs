# Week 15 - Final Week Plans

My plan for our final week is to have everyone bring their Raspberry Pis and any coding, documents, preliminary research work they may have done for their final projects. We can workshop through the projects and make certain that you are on track. Additionally, I will be sharing preparatory materials for the final exam.
