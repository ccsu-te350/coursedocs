# Week 9 Assignment - Javascript Intro

Javascript Introduction \(to run code, they recommend you use Mozilla's Firefox browser & activate its Scratchpad in its Dev Tools; an alternative in Google Chrome is to use the Snippets in Chrome's Dev Tools\)

### Read / Begin here:

* [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)  & [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar\_and\_types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types)
  * please note, however, despite the MDN Learn documentation \(and any W3Schools tutorials you may use for Javascript\), since we are working with the latest version of Javascript, we prefer the use of `let` to `var` when setting variables. Both work much of the time \(and at this level\), but use of `let` is preferable in most circumstances, as mentioned in the lecture last week and also noted in documentation, such as this StackOverflow article: [https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/274342/is-there-any-reason-to-use-the-var-keyword-in-es6](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/274342/is-there-any-reason-to-use-the-var-keyword-in-es6)

#### Doing the exercises / writing javascript while in your browser - use your browser's Dev Tools' Console \(in Chrome browser, use F12 to launch Dev Tools, go to Console tab\):

* Article on use of Google Chrome browser dev tools - [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/use-devtools](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/use-devtools)
* You may want to try Scratchpad if using Mozilla Firefox as your browser \(introduction to Scratchpad, a tool where you can write javascript in your Firefox browser's Dev Tools: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad)\)
