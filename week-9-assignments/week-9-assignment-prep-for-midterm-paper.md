# Week 9 - Assignment - Prep for Class / Mid-term project

Paper preparations. Search & find at least 3 scholarly articles that you will use to support your short paper assignment which is due Monday, November 8**.** 

**Bring the information you have about those articles to class on Monday, 10/28/19.** Additionally, make a list of any challenges you are having with research for the paper to Monday's class. You will be "workshopping" how to cite your sources and use the library for research in preparation for this project. 

**Short Paper, Due Monday, November 4, 2019  \(up to 8 points\)**

| **Midterm \(short paper\)** |  | **up to 8 points** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |


Mid-term project: 1 concept-related short \(approx. 2-3 pages\) paper on: \(1\) computational thinking and how it might apply to engineering technology curricula \(with specific examples\); \(2\) open as an educational approach \(e.g., open pedagogy, open source software & hardware, open educational resources\) and how it would apply to teaching coding/computational thinking; \(3\) growth mindset / stereotype threat and how and why you might use it as part of teaching computational thinking/coding  


You will have a class Monday, 10/28/19 that will highlight how the library can help you and -- in particular -- ensure that you are aware of and able to effectively use citations \(will have them work with you with APA format\). They will also cover how libraries’ maker spaces can aid you in your work as educators & how librarians’ work has informed topics that are particularly web/coding relevant such as information architecture.
