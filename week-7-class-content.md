**Exercise on HTML debugging \(with git practice, too\):**

1. Fork this git repository to your own github account for debugging practice \([https://github.com/ccsu-te350/debugging-html](https://github.com/ccsu-te350/debugging-html)\)
2. Use git to clone down the forked repository to a directory on your local machine
3. Find the debugging html section \(open and work with debug-example.html\)
4. Work through fixing the example html file \(note types of issues in our class slides - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6tUmWSASJBosDxJa4D88FpQVWN9ClslIYR4nLC753U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6tUmWSASJBosDxJa4D88FpQVWN9ClslIYR4nLC753U/edit?usp=sharing)\)
5. Test your revised html against the W3 Validator at [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
6. Keep fixing any remaining issues, until your html validates
7. Remember to commit for every change you notice and fix with an appropriate message
8. Remember to push changes upstream to your github account
