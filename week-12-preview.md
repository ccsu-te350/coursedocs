# Week 12 - Preview

Since several of you will be unavailable next week, I wanted to offer you enough information so that you can keep up while out of the classroom. Probably our assignments will include components of JS, Scratch, and mostly work on progress towards your final projects. 

**WHAT WE WILL COVER DURING THE WEEK OF 11/11  & 11/13**

Scratch intro –

* Creating \(or reaccessing existing\) scratch accounts at the[ https://scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/) website.  
* Scratch is also native on your Raspberry Pi and/or you can download it to a PC or Mac computer desktop for offline program creation at[ https://scratch.mit.edu/download](https://scratch.mit.edu/download)

Note: today’s Scratch is version 3. Some of the documentation I offer may need to be updated. Feel free to take that on for extra credit.
