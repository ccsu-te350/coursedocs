# Final Exam

Basically, the following are some of the key areas / terminology & concepts that will be covered. This may not be exact or it may be overly broad. Review the slides from classes and the basic tutorials and readings required.

* something on open source software, what that means, why it matters
* something on growth mindset
* What is computational thinking - what are its 4 components and what do they mean?

   \(review [Week 10, Day 2 slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v5d52pXk_mC2-tKkmCpr1y3SDcGw5oQb41RzSHqLjyo/edit?usp=sharing) & references/resources\) 

  1. **Decomposition: Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, manageable parts**
  2. **Pattern Recognition: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data**
  3. **Abstraction: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns**
  4. **Algorithm Design: Developing the step by step instructions for solving this and similar problems Reference:** [**https://computationalthinkingcourse.withgoogle.com/unit**](https://computationalthinkingcourse.withgoogle.com/unit)

* Python basic facts, recognize how it was created / works at the broadest level \(interpreted / compiled?\)
* What tools you would need to work with Python?
* What options are on the Raspberry Pi to help you teach coding
* What is the difference between git / github
* Are Java and Javascript the same thing?
* Where does Javascript run natively, how can you run Javascript \(hint: dev tools, remember how to launch?\)
* What are "events" in programming?
* What are variables, why are they important?
  * What are appropriate modern statements that setup variables \(primarily Javascript, may include Python example, but focus on Javascript most\)
* What are functions, why are they important?
* What are bindings?
* What is a string, what other types of data can you have in a program and why does the type of data matter? Can you convert data types?  
* What is a way to designate that something recur? 
* something about loops
* something about booleans
* something about conditionals
* assignments v. operators
* something about event-driven coding / what is an event
* what is an object, array, a list
* something about the order of coding
* something about functions, what they are and why they matter
* In the HTML/CSS/Javascript sentence, which is the noun, which is the adjective, and which is the verb & why? \(i.e., what does each type of code do, maybe what file extensions the code files should have, how would you reference external files and should you\)
* what is git? what is github?
* Scratch stuff 
  * what types of things it can do?
  * can you save its files only to the scratch site?
  * can it interact with objects?
  * what is needed to start the code running?
  * what are sprites and why do they matter?
  * can you create functions / how to do so in Scratch
  * something about separate sprites & their interactions
  * something about variables / changeable values in the blocks
  * something about Scratch 3’s extension**s**
* Some Raspberry Pi stuff
* code that is interpreted v. compiled
* DOM \(document object model\) - what is it, why does it matter?
* APIs - what does API mean?
* parts of a statement
* Dev tools in Chrome
* How to find help \(where to search, documentation, tutorials\)

**Essays \(something like one or both of these?\):**

Name one thing that you found valuable about this course, something that you will take away from it, what is one thing that you would change about the course if you were teaching it and why, 

Self-assessment: what did you learn in this course that surprised you / that you think you will carry over, what advice would you give to yourself if you were able to give yourself advice retrospectively \(to the you of the beginning of semester\). Self assess your performance from the professor’s perspective - how good were you at attendance, work in the class, homework, doing readings / following tutorials outside of class? What other criteria would you use to assess yourself and how did you do?
