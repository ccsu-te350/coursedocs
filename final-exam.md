# Final Exam

Basically, the following are some of the key areas / terminology & concepts that will be covered. This may not be exact or it may be overly broad. Review the slides from classes.

* something on open source software, what it is, why it matters
* something on growth mindset
* something on computational thinking \(identify its 4 facets & understand what they mean\)
* Python basic facts, recognize how it was created / works at the broadest level \(interpreted / compiled?\)
* What tools you would need to work with Python?
* What options are on the Raspberry Pi to help you teach coding
* What is the difference between git / github
* Are Java and Javascript the same thing?
* Where does Javascript run natively, how can you run Javascript \(hint: dev tools, remember how to launch?\)
* What are "events" in programming?
* What are variables, why are they important?
  * What are appropriate modern statements that setup variables \(primarily Javascript, may include Python example, but focus on Javascript most\)
* What are functions, why are they important?
* **What are bindings?**
* **What is a string, what other types of data can you have in a program and why does the type of data matter? Can you convert data types?** 
* **What is a way to designate that something recur?** 
* **something about loops**
* **something about booleans**
* **something about conditionals**
* **assignments v. operators**
* **something about event-driven coding / what is an event**
* **what is an object, array, a list**
* **something about the order of coding**
* **something about functions, what they are and why they matter**
* **What is computational thinking - what are its 4 components and what do they mean?** 

**Essays:**

**Name one thing that you found valuable about this course, something that you will take away from it, what is one thing that you would change about the course if you were teaching it and why,** 

**Self-assessment: what did you learn in this course that surprised you / that you think you will carry over, what advice would you give to yourself if the you of today you were advising the you of the beginning of semester. Self assess your performance from the professor’s perspective - how good were you at attendance, work in the class, homework, doing readings / following tutorials outside of class? Did you feel like you did anything close to the 6 hours / week on average that a college-level 3 cr course asks of you - why or why not?**  


**Is Java the same as Javascript?**

**in the HTML/CSS/Javascript sentence, which is the noun, which is the adjective, and which is the verb & why?**  


**what is git? what is github?**  


**Some Scratch stuff** 

* **what types of things it can do?**
* **can you save its files only to the scratch site?**
* **can it interact with objects?**
* **what is needed to start the code running**
* **something about parallel blocks of code**
* **something about separate sprites & their interactions**
* **something about my blocks as functions**
* **something about variables / changeable values in the blocks**
* **something about Scratch 3’s extensions - e.g., for Pen**

**Some Raspberry Pi stuff**  
  
  


**interpreted v. compiled**

**document object model** 

**APIs**   


**why does coding matter, from your perspective?**  


**parts of a statement**  


**Dev tools in chrome**

**How to find help \(Stack Overflow, documentation, tutortals\)**

**More on computational thinking**
