# Week 3 Assignments

If you haven't yet "joined" the ccsu-te350 organization on Github, please do so: [https://github.com/ccsu-te350](https://github.com/ccsu-te350)

This allows you to more easily "fork" repositories, share them, submit assignments, have me / classmates help troubleshoot your code when needed.

* [ ] Make **3** git repositories \(any content you want\) & push them to github repos
  * [ ] Ideally, you will include at least 1 repo that is built from a clone of your github-based fork of [https://github.com/ccsu-te350/emoji-commit](https://github.com/ccsu-te350/emoji-commit)
* [ ] Send me an email with the addresses of these public github repos.

At the very least, this will force you through git workflows \(git commands & most likely a few command line commands\), such as:

* `git init`
* `git clone`
* `git status`
* `git add` 
* `git commit`
* `git log / git reflog` 
* `git remote`
* `git push`

You should probably also try making a change in your github repo, then either pulling it down using git pull or using the 2-step equivalent of git fetch + git merge

CLI/command line commands we used today:

* `pwd`
* `mkdir`
* `cd`
* `ls`
* `touch`

For troubleshooting errors or finding help with a specific git command, a commercial web search engine like Google is your friend. Stack Overflow is a website where people working with code / information technology, including git, commonly post questions and problems as well \(e.g., [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git)\).
