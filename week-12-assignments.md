# Week 12 - Assignments

1. Build a Scratch project that demonstrates practice in at least of the aspects of Computational Thinking \(you can build a project from one of the recipe cards, if desired\), share it, send me the url at which I can try it out\).
2. Write a lesson plan for teaching that aspect of Computational Thinking through that Scratch project. Note what grade level students you are targeting, what learning objectives you have you have for them through the project-based lesson, and how you will assess the degree to which the students are successful. 
3. Create a brief project proposal for your Raspberry Pi-based final project. If you will be using a github repository that you have found or a "recipe" that someone offered online for the project, provide the reference in the proposal so that I can see it as well.
