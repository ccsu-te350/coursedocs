# Week 11 - Assignments

More to come, but as of Mon., 11/4/19, Review & do the work found in:

* Storing the Information you need - Variables - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First\_steps/Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables)
* Basic math in JavaScript â€” numbers and operators - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First\_steps/Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)
* Handling text / strings - [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First\_steps/Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)

Fork the repository, clone it locally, then modify the wording on the html button and javascript based message at [https://github.com/ccsu-te350/Wk11-JS-buttonNamePrompt](https://github.com/ccsu-te350/Wk11-JS-buttonNamePrompt). Troubleshoot any mistakes that you may make that get in the way of it working.

Note the difference between the in-page javascript & the external .js script file. 

As needed, review the [class content slides](week-11-class-content.md)
