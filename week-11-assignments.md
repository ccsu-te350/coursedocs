# Week 11 - Assignments

**Due: 11/13/19**

The part of the work / assignment that you will **turn in** to me should be fairly quick to do, if you’ve been able to keep up with class, readings, and doing the practice exercises that MDN/W3Schools offer. If you are a little behind on the coding or git, it will take a little longer as you will have more to look up and/or troubleshoot. \(That’s why the portion of these lessons that I don’t require you to turn in -- the review of various readings / exercises -- are so important. Doing them saves you time in the long-run and yields better results on the exams.\) The specific directions are to:

* Fork the following repository, clone it locally -[ https://github.com/ccsu-te350/Wk11-JS-buttonNamePrompt](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fccsu-te350%2FWk11-JS-buttonNamePrompt&data=01%7C01%7Csclapp%40ccsu.edu%7Cc69c46b78fe8450316e908d7660a3354%7C2329c570b5804223803b427d800e81b6%7C0&sdata=5ooLFd6HPwr9u%2FsM61dxw4RGGb%2F8rIqI23BfG87gOjw%3D&reserved=0).
* Then modify the wording on the html button and javascript based message \(to whatever you would like, just to get the experience of seeing where in the code these changes would be made\). Modify it in both the internal and external JS versions of the 2 html files.
  * \(While doing this work, though you do not have to answer in the assignment about these matters, please notice the differences in how the script code is referenced and where in the html that script / reference to the script lives. Also, please notice the use of the const binding for one of the “variables”. Which one is it, you can ask yourself, and why does using “const” work, instead of either the “let” or “var” binding statements?\)
  * Make sure to test your code to see that it is working. It should work and not throw any errors for full points.
  * Troubleshoot any mistakes that may arise along the way. Do any necessary research on your own to troubleshoot \(e.g., search on Google, Stack Overflow, or other places, revisit the readings / tutorials at MDN or W3Schools\).
* Send me an email with a link to your repository.

Below, find pieces of the assignment for this week that you are _not required to **turn in**,_ but provide necessary review, practice, and/or extra credit. Read/review/practice to further your understanding \(which will support your performance in the final exam and in the projects that you will be required to do\):

See also: the W3Schools’ training on Javascript _\(taken with grain of salt, due to older style "bindings" / variable declaration statements -- using `var` instead of my appropriate & modern `let` & `const` - -but still helpful because of inline practice exercises "Try This"  that show and allow you to alter code\)_:

If you’d like extra credit & to practice the work we did in Week 11, feel free to get creative by customizing some code from the Github repo on conditionals and then posting customized code onto a repo that you point me to:[  ](https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fccsu-te350%2FWk11-JS-Conditionals&data=01%7C01%7Csclapp%40ccsu.edu%7Cc69c46b78fe8450316e908d7660a3354%7C2329c570b5804223803b427d800e81b6%7C0&sdata=0ZBWzuMeWrI%2BQtBn6HaZw2YFaSEl4x4VWmrQH7BcrtU%3D&reserved=0)

Give me an explanation in your email about the customizations you have made, what you have learned from doing that work, and what you propose the value in extra points to be given the amount of work and learning you have had to put in to make those customizations.
