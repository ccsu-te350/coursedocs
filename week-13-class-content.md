**Slides: Wednesday, 11/20/19 \(Functions & Objects in Javascript\)**

**References \(to view, read & practice with\):**

* Lesson - Advanced Scratch w/the following LOs \(see: [https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~vijaya/ssrvm/dokuwiki/media/cm5\_l4\_22jun.pdf](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~vijaya/ssrvm/dokuwiki/media/cm5_l4_22jun.pdf)\):
  * How to capture the input from the user. 
  * How to write programs using variables and lists.
* Read / review Scratch wiki / documentation:
  * [https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Variables\_Blocks\_\(subcategory\)](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Variables_Blocks_%28subcategory%29) - Variables
  * [https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/My\_Blocks](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/My_Blocks) - Functions / My Blocks
  * [https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/List](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/List) - Lists / Arrays
  * [https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Broadcast) - Broadcast \(allow you to send signals / create interactions one sprite to another\)

**To Do \(In class\):**

* Create a new Scratch Project in which the primary sprite interacts with you - gets your name & greets you using this \[Sensing blocks / Variables\]
* In the same or another new Scratch Project, have your primary sprite draw a square \[Adding Pen Extension\]. Start with as many lines of codes as necessary. Then use looping to reduce the number of lines of code. Then refactor once again by turning the code into a function block and calling the function block. \[Looping / conditionals, functions\]
* Create a second sprite, create an interaction where the end of the drawing makes the 2nd sprite dance \[Broadcasting & receiving messages among sprites\]
* Save your projects & Share them
* Copy the link to your shared projects & send them to me
