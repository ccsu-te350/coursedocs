# Final Project

**Due Monday, 12/9/19, at 9:25AM:**

The final project will be worth up to **25** regular points with the potential for extra points. Here is what and how to turn the project in:

**What you will turn in will be:**

* The project, in the form of _**your Raspberry Pi’s micro SD card with the working code for your project on it**_, so that I can run it on one of my Pis as a test. I will give you a marked SD card bag, if you do not have one of your own, so that I can ensure that yours is not misidentified. For example, if you saved your Scratch, python, or html/css/javascript-based webpage to your Raspberry Pi, the files should be saved to the card. _\[If you will want your microSD card returned, please note this on your writeup of the project and you will be able to pick them up after I’ve graded the project.\]_
* The link to a publicly accessible github repository for the code - e.g., any Scratch \(.sb3\), python \(.py\), or html/css/javascript \(.html/.css/.js\), or other files \(e.g., if your recipe had you create a “shell script” - with a .sh file extension\). Do not turn it into Github Pages, unless you know you have made it publicly visible, by ensuring that your homepage / html page has the filename index.html.
* A written description of the project, offered in an electronic version \(if you hand in a physical document, that is fine _**in addition**_ to the e-version, but I need your work submitted electronically --  emailed, or linked via a public Github repo or even through a shared Google doc, to which you will have emailed me the link - it must have appropriate permissions for me to view it, my gmail account is sbclapp@gmail.com if you only want to invite me to view it\).
* In the final project writeup, you must include the following:
  * Which Pi the project is built for \(Raspberry Pi 3 or 4\).
  * The name of the code files included on your microSD card and where they would be found.  _\(e.g., note that in the /home/pi directory are index.html, styles.css, myscript.js and a folder with individual image files labelled images/\)_ 
  * The github repository’s URL.  _\(Make sure that you have not mistakenly made your github repo private for any reason. Do not use the Github Pages option, which allows Github to host your repo as a website, unless you have made certain that the base page is named index.html and will be publicly visible to me, as well as being forkable as a code repository.\)_
  * A recipe \(an algorithm!\) to build/replicate the project, cited to wherever you originally found the project you built.
  * Notes on what worked, along with anything that did not work / needed to be changed or debugged. Also, notes on how successful / easy the build was would be helpful. If there was something that you would add on in a future project \(e.g., if it were for a longer-term project, please feel free to add this for extra points\)
  * Your lesson plan with: \(1\) a target audience of learners, by grade level and \(2\) which of the 4 computational thinking principles you think that the project touches upon and how it helps learners better grasp that principle / those principles.
  * Citations for anything you used as the basis of this work, not only the recipe / project itself, but any videos, tutorials, debugging articles / tools you had to use along the way. _I won’t require that scholarly works to be included and in this case, if you do give me APA, formatting, you will receive **extra points**._
